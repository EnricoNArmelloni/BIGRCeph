# Welcome to the BIGRCeph GitHub repository

## Structure of the folder

### Code "code" contains the subfolders "R" and "stan".
 - the R subfolder contains the code used to perform the analysis. The scripts to replicate results are named with logic order (step1, step2 etc.). Supporting functions file contains custom functions that are used in the other scripts. Appendix_S1 contains the code used for the simulation study described in Appendix_A
 - the stan folder contains all the stan models representing model variants described in the manuscript. Stan files requires compilation, which create large files. In the folders are only provided the compiled files for the best model variants for space reason.

The folder "data" contains supplementary data and other files generated by the R scripts. 
The files needed to start the analysis are:

- st1_experimental_details.csv summarizes the details of the experiments. This file is needed in the script Step1
- st2_sample_info contains all the data available in the experiments. This file is needed in the script Step2
- diet_info contains the formatted information associated to each experiment regarding prey type, prey amount (procedure described in the manuscript) and temperature. This file is needed in the script Step 1.

All the other files contained in the folders are generated with the R scripts provided

The folder results contains the results generated by the R scripts. Model fits and diagnostics are only provided for the best model variants.
